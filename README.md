Fitting Sugeno Integrals to Data
================================

Marek Gagolewski, Simon James, and Gleb Beliakov,
*Supervised Learning to Aggregate Data with the Sugeno Integral*,
2018.

A Cython implementation of the exact branch-refine-and-bound-type algorithm
for fitting Sugeno integrals with respect to symmetric capacities
minimizing mean absolute (L1) error,
particularly suitable for the case of ordinal data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Main function: `fit_Sugeno_L1_brnb()` in `fit_Sugeno_L1_brnb.pyx`
(requires Cython and a C compiler) --
finds a best MAE fit for the Sugeno integral:

```
Arguments
=========

x - an m*n matrix representing m decreasingly (weakly) ordered input samples of length n

y - a vector of m reference outputs

maxiter - maximal number of iterations to perform


Returns
=======

Dictionary with keys:

* f - fitness at the solution
* h - a vector of n increasing coefficients  with h[n-1]=1
* niter - number of iterations performed
* success - False if maxiter reached


Example
=======

import pyximport
import numpy as np
pyximport.install(reload_support=True, setup_args={"include_dirs": np.get_include()})
import fit_Sugeno_L1_brnb as fit

x = ...inputs...
y = ...reference outputs...
result = fit.fit_Sugeno_L1_brnb(x, y)
```
